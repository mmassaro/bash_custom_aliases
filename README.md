The file *custom.aliases.bash* is a collection of useful aliases that I use.
The function can be use directly in your *.bashrc* but in my case I use it as 
a custom file with [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).

alert / sms
===========

* **alert** is useful to signal the end of a short simulation.
* **sms** is useful to signal the end of a long simulation by sending an SMS.
  Some parameters such as the execution time, the error, ... can be added.
  See my other repository, [send_sms](https://github.com/mmassaro/send_sms),
  for the script.
